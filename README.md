## Installation

In your command line first you will need to run "npm i" to download the dependencies. Then intiate the database with "mysql -u root -p". Afterwards "source db/schema.sql" to create the tables. Exit your sql and enter "npm run seed" to seed the data into your tables.  Finally you can run "npm start" to start your server.
